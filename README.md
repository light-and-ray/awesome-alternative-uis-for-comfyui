Here is a collection of alternative UI that use ComfyUI backend for image generation. The order doesn't matter. Don't hesitate to open an issue or pr if you want to add something

## ● Flow - Streamlined Way to ComfyUI

Flow is a custom node designed to provide user-friendly interface for ComfyUI by acting as an alternative user interface for running workflows. It is not a replacement for workflow creation.

This is a UI extension for ComfyUI adding an additional inference focused UI, that dynamically adapts to your workflows - you only need to change the titles of nodes that you want to see in the Minimalistic webui, and click "Refresh" button. Also can work as a standalone server
